### What is Korus ###

Korus is a very simple yet powerful parallel and distributed programming framework.  It aims to improve the performance and scalability of Java applications.

<br />
### Why you should try Korus? ###

**1. Futuristic approach:** Make your programs ready for the next generation multi-core hardware.

**2. Inherent Concurrency:** No need to understand thread-programming to use Korus. Korus provides **thread-less concurrency** by way of code-context-switching.

**3. Actor Pattern:** Korus is based on Actor Design Pattern (characterized by inherent concurrency of computation within). One of first “pure” actor pattern frameworks in Java.

**4. Non Blocking concurrency, No thread synchronization, No Deadlock and Starvation**

**5. Very Simple:** Korus is very simple to use, very simple to deploy (one single jar file), and very simple to understand. Try it out yourself here.

### Getting Started ###

Getting started with Korus is as fast as Korus itself.

Download Sample.zip from [here](http://korus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Product/korus/example/Sample.zip). Execute the file run.bat or run.sh depending on your OS

You can download the [Korus](http://korus.googlecode.com/files/Korus-bin-1.0.zip) from the download section. It consists of sample programs, Java docs and korus.jar file.

The best way to start is by having a look at the [Getting started page](http://code.google.com/p/korus/wiki/GettingStarted). If you want to have a very quick feel go to the Getting Started Quickly section in guide. It will take only 5 minutes to run the sample program if you have a JDK environment.
